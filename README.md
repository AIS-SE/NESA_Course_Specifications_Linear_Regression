# NESA Course Specifications Linear Regression

This Jupyter Notebook collection is designed to support students understand the Linear Regression model defined in the [NESA Software Engineering Course Specifications](https://library.curriculum.nsw.edu.au/341419dc-8ec2-0289-7225-6db7f2d751ef/94e1eb0a-0df7-4dbe-9b72-5d5e0d17143a/software-engineering-11-12-higher-school-certificate-course-specifications.PDF) pg 28.

Several versions have been provided to support students understand the specification and apply it in different contexts:

1. The [Raw Demonstration](1.raw_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specification provides a direct application (after debugging) of each step of the algorithm.
2. The [Graphical Demonstration](2.graphical_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications provides graphs visualising each step of the algorithm.
3. The [CSV Demonstration](3.CSV_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications uses a CSV upload of the data so larger model training data sets can be used.
4. The [SQL Demonstration](4.SQL_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications imports the data from a SQL database so the data can be managed in a datbase.
5. The [Export Import Demonstration](5.export_import_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications exports the model so a separate Python implementation can use it to make predictions. The demonstration also includes how to save a Matplotlib image so it can be used in a UI.
6. The [Feature Engineering Demonstration]() blah blah
7. The [Data Preprocessing Demonstration](7.data_preprocessing.ipynb) provides a demonstration of a basic data preprocessing using the Pandas library.
8. The [Data Wrangling Demonstration](8.data_wrangling.ipynb) provides a demonstration of wringling data to refine your machine learning model.
9. The [Model Testing and Validation Demonstration](8.model_evaluation.ipynb) provides a number of ways to evaluate, test and validate your model using a second set of test data and then refine your model. This demonstration uses a different regression algorithm to the course specifications.

   > There are some variations from the NESA course specifications to address syntax errors, missing methods and readability.
