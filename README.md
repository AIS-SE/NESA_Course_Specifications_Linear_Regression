# NESA Course Specifications Linear Regression

This Jupyter Notebook collection is designed to support students understand the Linear Regression model defined in the [NESA Software Engineering Course Specifications](https://library.curriculum.nsw.edu.au/341419dc-8ec2-0289-7225-6db7f2d751ef/94e1eb0a-0df7-4dbe-9b72-5d5e0d17143a/software-engineering-11-12-higher-school-certificate-course-specifications.PDF) pg 28.

Several versions have been provided to support students understand the specification and apply it in different contexts:

1. The [Raw Demonstration](raw_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specification provides a direct application (after debugging) of each step of the algorithm.
2. The [Graphical Demonstration](graphical_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications provides graphs visualising each step of the algorithm.
3. The [CSV Demonstration](CSV_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications uses a CSV upload of the data so larger model training data sets can be used.
4. The [Output input Demonstration](export_import_course_specification.ipynb) of the course specifications exports the model so a separate Python implementation can use it to make predictions. The demonstration also includes how to save a Matplotlib image so it can be used in a UI.
5. The [Model Evaluation Demonstration](cost_evaluation.ipynb) provides a number of ways to evaluate your model using a second set of test data and then refine your model. This demonstration uses a different regression algorithm to the course specifications.

> There are some variations from the NESA course specifications to address syntax errors, missing methods and readability.
